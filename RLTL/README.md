# Learning an RL agent for traffic lights 

## Description

A simple MLP agent is trained in a gym wrapper around CityFlow using PPO.

The environment wrapper can be found in `env1x1.py`. 
An agent can be trained by running `python train.py` and then evaluated and compared
to random and cyclic policies by running `python evaluate.py`.
